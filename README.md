# GolfGame
A simple golf game made using Processing 3


GOAL: To hit the golf ball into the hole within 10 attempts.
HOW: The player sees a moving red triangle (Ball Launcher) across the bottom of the screen. By pressing the SPACE key, the player can stop at their desired location. The strenght meter (on the left) will increase in length and lighter in colour depicting the strengh of the hit. By pressing the SPACE key again the player can shoot the ball at their desired strength. The ball will then be launched onto the grass (rebound off the top of the screen if full strength). If the user gets the ball fully inside the hole, they win.
